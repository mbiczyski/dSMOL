 Drone Swarm Modelling and Optimisation Language

Domain Specific language written as an Individual Research Project (IRP) for a Master's degree in Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control at Cranfield University in 2018.

dSMOL folder contains language files. 
test_scenario.rkt is the main file of an example project using simulated annealing to optimise control parameters of a drone swarm in an environment with moving obstacles.
Also included are two presentations about the state of the project at different stages (interim and final).
